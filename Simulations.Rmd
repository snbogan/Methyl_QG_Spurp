This markdown includes simulations of genetically-correlating gene expression traits and DNA methylation of corresponding gene bodies across 80 RNA-seq replicates derived froma 40 full-/half-sib families split and reared across two environments.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

setwd("~/Documents/GitHub/Methyl_QG_Spurp/")

# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(nadiv)
library(brms)

```

Simulate data for one gene with genetic and environmental effects on DNA methylation and gene expression

```{r}

# Write out experimental pedigree
pedi <- read.csv("pedigree.csv")

# With nadiv, create a relatedness matrix, not an inverse relatedness matrix, which is necessary for brms
relat_m <- as.matrix(makeA(pedig))


```
